Worked with the imbalanced dataset using SMOTE technique and then tried to achieve the best balance between detecting fraud and non-fraud transactions with Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost Classifier.
Random Forest and XGBoost classifires gave the best results being able to detect more than 80% of the fraud transactions and at the same time not classifying a lot of non-fraud transactions as fraud, which is also very important in this case.
